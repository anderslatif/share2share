# Soon

Have a look at util.js

Unify the way I show and hide the different screens.
Convert .file-explorer => #file-explorer

Handle downloading nested files in directories.

Create a markdown table in README for the different event types.

# Near Future

Create logic that closes the Firebase connection and the peer connection to avoid memory leaks and problems with reconnecting. 
If the peer tries to leave without having shared anything, then perhaps give a warning
Fix Firebase rules
Show the files that will be downloaded in the download screen, including their size. This requires the first message sent to be the file list.
Consider allowing downloading individual files as well as all.

1. Create a cute animation while connecting to peer for the answer candidate. 
2. Inform the offer candidate of connection and what files are being downloaded.

# Future



Delete documents in Firestore after a week or month.
Allow for continuous upload even after sharing.
Could be sweet if there is a "all good/ done" button as long as heart that can be sent between each other...
